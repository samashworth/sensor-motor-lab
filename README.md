================

This repository contains an implementation of "Task 6 - Sensor and motor's lab" for the Project I class at Carnegie Mellon University. The repository is the work of Team Herbie. The lab requires us to program an Arduino to read 4 sensors (thermistor, UV range sensor, rotary encoder, and force sensor) and to control three motors (DC motor, stepper motor, and servo motor). Additionally, a UI must be created that allows the user to see the readings of the sensors and control the motors. Further, it must be possible to have the sensors directly control the motors.
